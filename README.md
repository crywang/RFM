## Overview

![headimg](./src/headimg.jpg)

## Setup

This repository is build upon Python v3.8 and Pytorch v1.7.0 on Ubuntu 18.04. 

You have to request datasets from:

1. [FaceForensics ++ : Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)

2. [On the Detection of Digital Face Manipulation](http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-ffd.html)
3. [Celeb-DF: A Large-scale Challenging Dataset for DeepFake Forensics](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics)

and extra model from:

1. [What makes fake images detectable? Understanding properties that generalize](https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/)

### For training:

The default baseline model is xception. If the datasets mentioned above are ready to use, run:

```
python train.py
```

### For visualization:

Average FAM can be generated for representative forgery visualization, run:

```
python AvgFAM.py
```

Models pretrained on [celebdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-QqinypEk0JqFnSTI_qDAfY2kNlegy7W/view?usp=sharing) and [dffd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wj87F2XSpZhGlZ_HNDRV4SAO5D6n40BN/view?usp=sharing).
